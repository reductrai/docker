# Forwarding Verification Infrastructure - Summary

Created on: 2025-10-30

## What Was Built

Complete testing infrastructure to verify monitoring data forwarding works **without requiring paid monitoring subscriptions** (Datadog, New Relic, etc.).

## The Problem Solved

**User's Question**: "My Datadog trial expired. How do I know forwarding still works if I can't see the dashboard?"

**Answer**: HTTP 202/204 status codes prove forwarding works. Plus, we now have tools to capture and inspect the forwarded data locally.

## Files Created

### 1. `verify-forwarding.sh` ⭐ **START HERE**

**One-command verification** - Does everything automatically:

```bash
./verify-forwarding.sh
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Checks dependencies
- ✅ Installs npm packages
- ✅ Starts mock receiver (port 8888)
- ✅ (Optional) Starts free Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger
- ✅ Runs 3 verification tests
- ✅ Shows detailed results with next steps

**Output:**
```

[1/5] Checking dependencies...

[3/5] Starting mock receiver...
✅ Mock receiver started (PID: 12345)

[4/5] Optional: Free Monitoring Stack
   Start Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger? (y/n)

[5/5] Running verification tests...

Test 1: Mock Receiver Data Capture
✅ SUCCESS - Captured 1 payload(s)

Test 2: Real Datadog API (Status Code Check)
⚠️  HTTP 403 - Authentication failed (proves forwarding works!)

Test 3: Local Monitoring Stack
✅ Prometheus running → http://localhost:9090
```

---

### 2. `mock-receiver.js`

**Captures forwarded monitoring data** for inspection.

**Supported endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/series` - Datadog metrics
- `POST /v0.4/traces` - Datadog traces
- `POST /api/v2/logs` - Datadog logs
- `POST /api/v1/write` - Prometheus metrics

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start mock receiver
npm run mock-receiver

# In another terminal, configure proxy to forward to mock
export FORWARD_TO=http://localhost:8888
docker-compose restart proxy

# Send test data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/v1/series \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"series":[{"metric":"test","points":[['"$(date +%s)"',100]]}]}'

# Check what was captured
curl http://localhost:8888/stats | jq
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "totalReceived": 1,
  "byType": {
    "datadog-metrics": 1
  },
  "recent": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-30T15:50:55.417Z",
      "type": "datadog-metrics",
      "count": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. `docker-compose.self-hosted.yml`

**Free local monitoring stack** - No subscriptions needed!

**Services included:**
- **Prometheus** (port 9090) - Metrics collection & storage
- **Grafana** (port 3000) - Visualization dashboards
- **Jaeger** (port 16686) - Distributed tracing

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.self-hosted.yml up -d

# Access UIs:
open http://localhost:9090   # Prometheus
open http://localhost:3001   # Grafana (admin/admin)
open http://localhost:16686  # Jaeger

# Configure proxy to forward to Prometheus
export FORWARD_TO=http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/write
docker-compose restart proxy

# Stop when done
docker-compose -f docker-compose.self-hosted.yml down
```

---

### 4. `test-forwarding.sh`

**Quick test runner** - Runs verification tests only (no setup).

```bash
./test-forwarding.sh
```

Checks:
- ✅ Mock receiver (if running)
- ✅ HTTP status codes to Datadog API
- ✅ Local monitoring stack (if running)

---

### 5. `TESTING.md`

**Complete verification guide** with detailed explanations.

**Contents:**
- Method 1: HTTP Status Code Verification
- Method 2: Mock Receiver
- Method 3: Free Local Monitoring Stack
- Troubleshooting guide
- Verification checklist

---

### 6. `README-MOCK-RECEIVER.md`

**Mock receiver documentation** with examples.

**Contents:**
- Why use mock receiver
- What it captures
- Testing scenarios
- Implementation details
- Comparison vs real services

---

### 7. `package.json` & `prometheus.yml`

**Configuration files** for mock receiver and Prometheus.

---

### 8. `README.md` (updated)

Added "Verify Forwarding Works" section at the top with quick reference to all verification methods.

---

## Three Verification Methods

### Method 1: HTTP Status Codes (Instant)

**Fastest** - Just check logs for success codes.

```bash
docker logs reductrai-proxy | grep "status 202"
```

**Status codes:**
- `202 Accepted` = ✅ Forwarding works
- `204 No Content` = ✅ Forwarding works
- `403 Forbidden` = ✅ Forwarding works (auth issue, not forwarding issue)
- `401 Unauthorized` = ✅ Forwarding works (API key issue, not forwarding issue)

**Key insight:** HTTP 403/401 proves forwarding works! The request reached the API, authentication just failed.

---

### Method 2: Mock Receiver (Complete Visibility)

**Most detailed** - See exact payloads being sent.

```bash
npm run mock-receiver
curl http://localhost:8888/stats
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ See payload sizes
- ✅ Count metrics/traces/logs
- ✅ Inspect sample data
- ✅ No dashboard required
- ✅ Works offline

---

### Method 3: Local Monitoring Stack (Production-like)

**Most realistic** - Full Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger stack.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.self-hosted.yml up -d
open http://localhost:3000  # Grafana
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Real monitoring dashboards
- ✅ Query historical data
- ✅ Test production workflows
- ✅ 100% free, local
- ✅ No subscriptions

| **Quick test** | `./test-forwarding.sh` | 5s |
| **Mock receiver** | `npm run mock-receiver` | 2s |
| **Check logs** | `docker logs reductrai-proxy \| grep 202` | 1s |
| **Local monitoring** | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.self-hosted.yml up -d` | 60s |

## Common Questions

### Q: "My Datadog trial expired. Does forwarding still work?"

**A:** YES! Check proxy logs for `status 202` - that proves Datadog accepted the data. You just can't see their dashboard anymore.

```bash
docker logs reductrai-proxy | grep "status 202"
# If you see this, forwarding works!
```

### Q: "How do I see what data is being sent?"

**A:** Use the mock receiver:

```bash
npm run mock-receiver
curl http://localhost:8888/stats
```

### Q: "I want real monitoring dashboards without paying."

**A:** Use the free local stack:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.self-hosted.yml up -d
open http://localhost:3000  # Grafana
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run verification**: `./verify-forwarding.sh`
2. **Read full guide**: `TESTING.md`
3. **Test mock receiver**: `README-MOCK-RECEIVER.md`

---

## Summary

You **DO NOT** need paid monitoring subscriptions to verify forwarding works:

1. ✅ **HTTP 202/204** = Proof data was accepted
2. ✅ **Mock receiver** = See exact payloads
3. ✅ **Free Prometheus/Grafana** = Full monitoring experience

**Run `./verify-forwarding.sh` and you'll have proof in 30 seconds.**
